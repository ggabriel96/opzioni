# opzioni

opzioni is a command line arguments parser library for C++.
Its goals are, in order of importance:

1. **Be as simple and enjoyable as possible.**

    This mainly targets the user of the library, but also includes the user of the command line tool built with it.

1. **If it compiles, it works.**

    That's utopic, but that's what is being strived for.
    Most of the time, all the information needed to build a command line interface is available at compile-time, so we should take advantage of that.

1. **Be bleeding-edge.**

    This library requires C++20. That limits a lot its potential users, but also allows for the use of the new and powerful features of C++. It also helps to accomplish the previous goals.

These goals ought to be discussed in further detail in a separate document.
